## Introduction
PojavLauncher is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android based on [Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk). This launcher can launch almost all available Minecraft versions (from rd-132211 to latest 1.17 snapshot, including Combat Test versions). Modding via Forge and Fabric are also supported.

## Building
To get started, you can just get prebuilt app from [stable release](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/releases) or [automatic builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/actions). If you want to build after launcher code changes, follow steps below.

Will be moved to **BUILDING.md**
### Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- JRE for Android is [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/openjdk-multiarch-jdk8u), also the build script [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch).
- Follow build instruction on build script [README.md](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch/blob/buildjre8/README.md).
- You can also get [CI auto builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch/actions).
- Spliting JRE and put to the launcher: **coming soon**.

### LWJGL and GLFW
- **Coming soon**

### The Launcher
- Because languages are auto added by Crowdin, so need to run language list generator before building. In this directory, run:
```
# On Linux, Mac OS:
chmod +x scripts/languagelist_updater.sh
bash scripts/languagelist_updater.sh

# On Windows:
scripts\languagelist_updater.bat
```
- Then, build use Android Studio.

## Current status
- [x] ~~OpenJDK 9 Mobile port: ARM32, ARM64, x86, x86_64.~~ Replaced by JRE8.
- [x] OpenJDK 8 Mobile port: ARM32, ARM64, x86, x86_64
- [x] Mod installer headless
- [ ] Mod installer with GUI. Little run on `Caciocavallo` project.
- [x] OpenGL in OpenJDK environment
- [x] OpenAL (work on most devices)
- [x] Support Minecraft 1.12.2 and below. Used [lwjglx](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/lwjglx), a LWJGL2 compatibility layer for LWJGL3.
- [x] Support Minecraft 1.13 and above. Used [GLFW stub](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/lwjgl3-glfw-java).
- [x] Game surface zooming.
- [x] New input pipe rewritten to native code to boost performance.
