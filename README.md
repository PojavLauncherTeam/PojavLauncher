## Introduction
PojavLauncher is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android and iOS based on [Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk). This launcher can launch almost all available Minecraft versions (from rd-132211 to 21w09a (1.17) snapshot, including Combat Test versions). Modding via Forge and Fabric are also supported. This repository contains source code for Android. For iOS/iPadOS, check out [PojavLauncher_iOS](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS).

## Building
To get started, you can just get prebuilt app from [stable release](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/releases) or [automatic builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/actions). If you want to build after launcher code changes, follow steps below.

Will be moved to **BUILDING.md**
### Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- JRE for Android is [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/openjdk-multiarch-jdk8u), also the build script [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch).
- Follow build instruction on build script [README.md](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch/blob/buildjre8/README.md).
- You can also get [CI auto builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch/actions).
- Either get `jre8-pojav` artifact from auto builds, or do splitting by yourself:</br>
        - Get JREs for all of 4 supported architectures (arm, arm64, x86, x86_64) </br>
        - Split JRE into parts:</br>
                Platform-independent: .jar files, libraries, configs, etc...</br>
                Platform-dependent: .so files, etc...</br>
        - Create:</br>
                file named `universal.tar.xz` with all platform-independent files</br>
                4 files named `bin-<arch>.tar.xz` with all platform-dependent files per-architecture</br>
        - Put these in `assets/components/jre/` folder</br>
        - (If needed) update the Version file with the current date</br>

### LWJGL
- **Coming soon**

### The Launcher
- Because languages are auto added by Crowdin, so need to run language list generator before building. In this directory, run:
```
# On Linux, Mac OS:
chmod +x scripts/languagelist_updater.sh
bash scripts/languagelist_updater.sh

# On Windows:
scripts\languagelist_updater.bat
```
- Then, run these commands ~~build use Android Studio~~.
```
# Build GLFW stub
./gradlew :jre_lwjgl3glfw:build
# mkdir app_pojavlauncher/src/main/assets/components/internal_libs
rm app_pojavlauncher/src/main/assets/components/lwjgl3/lwjgl-glfw-classes.jar
cp jre_lwjgl3glfw/build/libs/jre_lwjgl3glfw-3.2.3.jar app_pojavlauncher/src/main/assets/components/lwjgl3/lwjgl-glfw-classes.jar
        
# Build the launcher
./gradlew :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug
```
(Replace `gradlew` to `gradlew.bat` if you are building on Windows).

## Current status
- [x] ~~OpenJDK 9 Mobile port: ARM32, ARM64, x86, x86_64.~~ Replaced by JRE8.
- [x] OpenJDK 8 Mobile port: ARM32, ARM64, x86, x86_64
- [x] Mod installer headless
- [x] Mod installer with GUI. Used `Caciocavallo` project for AWT without X11.
- [x] OpenGL in OpenJDK environment
- [x] OpenAL (work on most devices)
- [x] Support Minecraft 1.12.2 and below. Used [lwjglx](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/lwjglx), a LWJGL2 compatibility layer for LWJGL3.
- [x] Support Minecraft 1.13 and above. Used [GLFW stub](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/lwjgl3-glfw-java).
- [x] Game surface zooming.
- [x] New input pipe rewritten to native code to boost performance.
- [ ] More...

## Known Issues
- Minecraft `21w10a` or newer are currently not yet supported due to the new GLSL usage.
- In 1.16 and up spawn eggs banners are white (you can fix this by adding this to your JVM flags 
`-Dorg.lwjgl.opengl.libname=libgl4es_115.so`, only works on 1.16 and up, do not use under this version)
- Controller mods aren't working
- Random crashes could happen very often on Android 5.x during game load or join world.
- With big modpacks textures could be messed up
- If you're using gl4es 1.1.5 on 1.16 and lower texture will bug out when hit a mob
- probably more, that's why we have a bug tracker ;)
