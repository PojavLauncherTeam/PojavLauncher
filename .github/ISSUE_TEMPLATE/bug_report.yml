# Making A Bug Issue 101:

# â€¢ First, and most important: Only Use English

# There's no one in the team who knows your [[specific]] language, so please translate them as necessary. This also applies at our Discord Support tickets.

# â€¢ Provide everything

# Never say this word: latest

# Never say that word upon determining your Android and PojavLauncher version.

# To check your Android Version, head over to Settings, then About Phone.

# For the PojavLauncher version, go to Settings, then Manage Apps (or anything like that), then PojavLauncher

# The log file is NOT named as latest.log, it is named latestlog.txt

# If you're on Android 10^, head over to sdcard/Android/data/net.kdt.pojavlaunch(.debug)/files/latestlog.txt.

# If you're below Android 10, then the directory is sdcard/games/PojavLauncher/

# â€¢ No Offtopic

# Instead of us helping, we will lock the issue to contributors instead. Please refrain from doing this
