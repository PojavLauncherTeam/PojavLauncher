      The log file called `latestlog.txt` is located under `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/net.kdt.pojavlaunch/files` (on Android 10 and higher) or `/storage/emulated/0/games/PojavLauncher/` (on Android 9 and lower). You may have to activate an option in your file explorer to see hidden files and folders. Recommended file managers are ZArchiver and MiXplorer. |

      Tip: You can attach files by clicking this area to highlight it and then dragging files in or select them on ðŸ–¼ option at the toolbar. Do not click anything before the file successfully uploads, otherwise the upload is going to stop and the file won't attach.
