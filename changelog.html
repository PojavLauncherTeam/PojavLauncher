  <h2>▶ 1.17: Now Works<a></h2>
	  <b>After many days and nights spent working on a temporary solution (and trust us, this is definitely temporary), we've got something done: support for 1.17 is here. With backporting work done by artdeell and Java 17 ported by DuyKhanhTran, 1.17 is usable and playable with gl4es.

Here's how to get it to work. You need to have a GitHub account in order to download the builds and JRE. <strike>Regardless of your platform, you'll need to download<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/724164160761626624/860864619350065162/assets-v0.zip">this resource pack.</a>  This is artdeell's patch for 1.17 on gl4es</strike>

	  <h2>▶ Offline mode is ending.</h2>
	  <b><h2>Should we be worried about it now?</h1></b>
	  Even though offline mode hasn't yet been taken down by Mojang, it's still technically piracy when you're using it, as you're getting the game for free (unless you bought it). Since GitHub and Mojang are owned by the same company, it's time we announce that we're putting our foot down.

<h4>In the future, offline mode will be changed to a new mode we call local mode. Local mode account users have the same restrictions as offline mode, plus some new ones:</h4></h>

<h3>• Local mode accounts will still be offline accounts, meaning that you're still limited by how offline accounts work.</h3>
<h3>• Local mode accounts are unable to download Minecraft through the launcher.</h3>
